# Reference: truth labels

**Quadrant:** Reference · **Audience:** contributors, canvas authors, proof reviewers

Every projected node, edge, metric, and proof claim in NLFR carries four truth
fields. Docs, diagrams, and proof samples must show at least `source_kind` and
`confidence` when citing claims.

Canonical rule: [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) · Product summary: [One pager](../../ONE_PAGER.md)

## Required fields

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `source_kind` | `collectable_v1`, `derived_v1`, `simulated_v1`, `future` | How the value entered the system |
| `confidence` | `high`, `medium`, `low`, `unknown` | Parser / projector confidence in the label |
| `evidence_refs` | string array | Stable refs (`run:{id}`, `artifact:{key}`, `run_group:{name}`) |
| `redaction_state` | `safe`, `redacted`, `blocked`, `unknown` | Privacy posture of the exported span |

## source_kind

| Value | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `collectable_v1` | Captured from real process output or attached artifacts with SHA-256 | Bazel BEP, NativeLink stdout, `record-agent-change.sh` sidecar |
| `derived_v1` | Computed from collectable rows by projectors | Compare deltas (M9), canvas layout bindings |
| `simulated_v1` | Deterministic fixture or scenario with no live LLM | `nlfr simulate` demo scenarios |
| `future` | Reserved claim type; not promoted without parser + proof script | Scheduler assignment, queue time |

## confidence

Use `high` only when direct evidence and parsers match without ambiguity.
Use `medium` for probe-success with environment variance (e.g. LRE parity on linux).
Use `low` or `unknown` when blockers or partial captures apply.

## evidence_refs

Pointers only — not raw log bodies. Typical patterns:

- `run:{stable_run_id}`
- `run_group:{label}`
- `artifact:bazel-test.log`
- `proof_block:cache_economics`

Compare projections (M9) must reference **both** left and right run groups.

## redaction_state

| Value | When |
|-------|------|
| `safe` | Public-safe export |
| `redacted` | Path or span redacted (hashes, short excerpts) |
| `blocked` | Withheld — privacy or policy |
| `unknown` | Ingest could not classify |

Never export raw prompts, credentials, or full private logs. M8 stores
`prompt_sha256` + `model` only: [Cursor adapter](../../../adapters/cursor/README.md).

## Conditional claims (M7)

`worker_identity` is `collectable_v1` **only when**:

1. `nativelink.stdout.txt` is attached pre-ingest, and
2. M7 `worker_admin_stdout` parser regex matches admin lines.

Runs without stdout do not carry worker identity claims. Scheduler, queue, and
placement remain `future` / unsupported:
[future fleet claims](../../dags/future-fleet-claims.md).

## Compare claims (M9)

Compare metrics are `derived_v1`. They summarize proof blocks per run group —
they do not reconstruct a unified worker graph across runs.

## Review checklist

- [ ] Every doc diagram caption names `source_kind`
- [ ] Fixture paths labeled `simulated_v1` where applicable
- [ ] No fleet dashboard language without proof block citation
- [ ] Proof samples in [proof-samples](../../proof-samples/README.md) include labels
